# TER Publishing Reference

**Purpose:** Document requirements and best practices for publishing TYPO3 extensions to the TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository)

## Overview

The TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) at [extensions.typo3.org](https://extensions.typo3.org) is the official distribution platform for TYPO3 extensions. Publishing is typically automated via GitHub Actions using the official `typo3/tailor` tool.

## Upload Comment Format

The "Last upload comment" field displayed on extension pages has specific format requirements:

### Allowed Content
- **Type:** Plain text only (no HTML, Markdown, or rich formatting)
- **Letters, numbers, whitespace**
- **Basic punctuation:** `" % & [ ] ( ) . , ; : / ? { } ! $ - @`
- **Newlines:** Supported and displayed as line breaks (`<br>`)

### Validation
- **Required:** Cannot be empty (throws `NoUploadCommentException`)
- **Storage:** `TEXT` field in database (no enforced length limit)

### Characters Stripped in XML Export
When exported to `extensions.xml` feed, the following regex filters the comment:
```
/[^\w\s"%&\[\]\(\)\.\,\;\:\/\?\{\}!\$\-\/\@]/u
```

**Stripped characters include:** `# * + = ~ ^ | \ < >` and non-ASCII special characters

### Rendering Contexts
| Context | Processing |
|---------|------------|
| Frontend (extension page) | `<f:format.nl2br>` - newlines become `<br>` |
| Email notifications | Raw text |
| XML feed (extensions.xml) | Sanitized via `xmlentities()` |

### Best Practices
1. **Keep it concise:** Focus on key changes
2. **Use line breaks:** Structure with newlines for readability
3. **Avoid special characters:** Stick to basic punctuation
4. **Be descriptive:** Summarize the release, not just "Bug fixes"

**Good Example:**
```
Fixed critical bug in authentication module
- Resolved token expiration issue
- Updated dependency versions
- Improved error messages for version constraints
```

**Avoid:**
```
Bug fixes & improvements! See CHANGELOG.md for details...
```
(The `&` will be escaped in the XML feed. ASCII `...` is fine — the XML-export regex above permits `.` — but the Unicode ellipsis `…` gets stripped since it's not in the allow-list.)

---

## CI TER Compatibility Check

**CRITICAL:** Add this check to your CI workflow to catch ext_emconf.php issues BEFORE release attempts!

**Add to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**
```yaml
- id: ter-compatibility
  name: TER Compatibility Check
  run: |
    # ext_emconf.php must NOT contain strict_types - TER cannot parse it
    # Use regex to match actual declaration (not comments mentioning it)
    if grep -qE "^[[:space:]]*declare\(strict_types" ext_emconf.php; then
      echo "::error file=ext_emconf.php::ext_emconf.php contains strict_types declaration which breaks TER publishing"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "TER compatibility check passed"
```

**Why this matters:** This check runs on every PR and push, catching strict_types issues before they reach a release attempt. Without this, you may only discover the problem when TER upload fails.

---

## Version Synchronization Check

**CRITICAL:** The `typo3/tailor` tool rejects uploads where the tag version does not match `ext_emconf.php` `'version'`. This is a common release failure.

### The Problem

When creating a release tag (e.g. `0.4.1`), `ext_emconf.php` must already contain `'version' => '0.4.1'`. If the version was not bumped before tagging, `tailor ter:publish` fails with "configured version does not match".

GitHub.com does not support custom pre-receive hooks, so server-side tag validation is not possible. Use **defense-in-depth**: local git hook + CI validation step.

### CI Workflow Step

Add this step to your TER publish workflow **after checkout and before publishing**:

```yaml
- name: Validate ext_emconf.php version
  env:
    TAG_VERSION: ${{ env.version }}
  run: |
    EMCONF_VERSION=$(grep -oP "'version'\s*=>\s*'\K[^']+" ext_emconf.php)
    if [[ "${TAG_VERSION}" != "${EMCONF_VERSION}" ]]; then
      echo "::error file=ext_emconf.php::Tag version (${TAG_VERSION}) does not match ext_emconf.php version (${EMCONF_VERSION}). Update ext_emconf.php before tagging."
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "Version validated: ${TAG_VERSION} matches ext_emconf.php"
```

### CaptainHook Pre-Push Hook

For local protection, add a pre-push hook script that checks any semver tag at HEAD:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

TAGS=$(git tag --points-at HEAD | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' || true)
[[ -z "${TAGS}" ]] && exit 0

EMCONF_VERSION=$(grep -oP "'version'\s*=>\s*'\K[^']+" ext_emconf.php)

while IFS= read -r TAG; do
    if [[ "${TAG}" != "${EMCONF_VERSION}" ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Tag ${TAG} does not match ext_emconf.php version ${EMCONF_VERSION}"
        exit 1
    fi
done <<< "${TAGS}"
```

Register in `captainhook.json` under `pre-push.actions[]`:
```json
{ "action": "Build/Scripts/check-tag-version.sh" }
```

### Release Process Checklist Addition

```
[ ] ext_emconf.php version bumped BEFORE creating tag
[ ] CI validates ext_emconf.php version matches tag
[ ] Pre-push hook validates locally
```

---

## CRITICAL: Upload Comment Source

**NEVER use git tag message for upload comments!**

### The Problem

When using `gh release create`, GitHub creates a **lightweight tag** (not annotated). Lightweight tags have no message, so `git tag -n1` returns the **commit message** instead:

```bash
# BAD: Gets commit message like "chore(release): v1.2.0 (#123)"
git tag -n1 -l "v${VERSION}" | sed "s/^v[0-9.]*[ ]*//g"
```

This results in TER showing unprofessional upload comments like:
- `chore(release): v13.2.0 (#508)`
- `Merge pull request #123 from feature/xyz`

### The Solution

**Always use `github.event.release.body`** (the GitHub release notes) as the comment source:

```yaml
env:
  RELEASE_BODY: ${{ github.event.release.body }}
run: |
  if [[ -n "${RELEASE_BODY}" ]]; then
    COMMENT=$(echo "${RELEASE_BODY}" | head -c 1000)
    # Strip unsupported characters
    COMMENT=$(echo "${COMMENT}" | sed 's/[#*+=~^|\\<>]//g')
  else
    COMMENT="Released version ${VERSION}"
  fi
```

### Conformance Check

When auditing extensions, verify `publish-to-ter.yml` uses:
- ✅ `github.event.release.body` - Release notes (CORRECT)
- ✅ `github.event.release.name` - Release title (fallback)
- ❌ `git tag -n1` - Tag/commit message (WRONG)

---

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Where the publish pipeline actually lives

This skill *checks* the TER publish setup; it does not own it. Building and maintaining the pipeline belongs to two other places, and an audit should recognise both rather than re-derive them:

| Owner | What it provides |
|-------|------------------|
| [`netresearch/typo3-ci-workflows`](https://github.com/netresearch/typo3-ci-workflows) | The implementation: reusable workflows `publish-to-ter.yml` (idempotency precheck, bounded post-publish verification, CHANGELOG-first upload comment, `ter:update` metadata sync) and `release-typo3-extension.yml` (build/sign, then TER, Packagist and docs in parallel). |
| `github-release` skill | The procedure: caller templates (`templates/release-typo3.yml`, `templates/ter-publish.yml`), plus `references/typo3-ter-publishing.md` and `references/ter-republish.md` for the version-match rules and the re-publish path. |

**For a Netresearch extension this is settled**: call the reusable workflow. Every unarchived `t3x-*` repository in the org routes TER through it, and none carries a hand-written `ter:publish` step. A caller is short enough to read in one screen:

```yaml
jobs:
  publish-to-ter:
    uses: netresearch/typo3-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/publish-to-ter.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
    secrets:
      TYPO3_TER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TYPO3_TER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
```

Note the caller correctly carries no Harden Runner step, no `persist-credentials: false` and no SHA-pinned action — the hardening sits in the callee, and org-owned reusable workflows stay on `@main` so upstream fixes propagate. Do not report that as a finding; see the checklist at the end of this file.

### Standalone template (no reusable workflow available)

Only for a repository that cannot call the reusable workflow — outside the org, or on a forge without it. It reproduces a subset of what the callee does and must then be maintained by whoever copies it.

**File:** `.github/workflows/publish-to-ter.yml`

**Template:** Copy from `assets/.github/workflows/publish-to-ter.yml`

```yaml
name: Publish new extension version to TER

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    name: Publish new version to TER
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      TYPO3_EXTENSION_KEY: ${{ secrets.TYPO3_EXTENSION_KEY }}
      TYPO3_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TYPO3_TER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate tag format
        run: |
          if ! [[ "${GITHUB_REF_NAME}" =~ ^v[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}$ ]]; then
            echo "::error::Invalid tag format '${GITHUB_REF_NAME}'. Expected format: v1.2.3"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Extract version
        id: version
        run: |
          # Strip 'v' prefix for TER (expects "3.0.1" not "v3.0.1")
          VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"
          echo "version=${VERSION}" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "Extracted version: ${VERSION}"

      - name: Prepare release comment
        id: comment
        env:
          RELEASE_BODY: ${{ github.event.release.body }}
          RELEASE_NAME: ${{ github.event.release.name }}
          RELEASE_URL: ${{ github.event.release.html_url }}
        run: |
          # Build comment from release body or name
          if [[ -n "${RELEASE_BODY}" ]]; then
            # Preserve newlines for TER display, limit length
            # TER supports newlines - they render as <br> on the frontend
            COMMENT=$(echo "${RELEASE_BODY}" | head -c 1000)
          elif [[ -n "${RELEASE_NAME}" ]]; then
            COMMENT="${RELEASE_NAME}"
          else
            COMMENT="Release ${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
          fi

          # Strip characters not supported in TER XML export
          # Allowed: word chars, whitespace, " % & [ ] ( ) . , ; : / ? { } ! $ - @
          COMMENT=$(echo "${COMMENT}" | sed 's/[#*+=~^|\\<>]//g')

          # Append release link on new line
          COMMENT="${COMMENT}

Details: ${RELEASE_URL}"

          # Escape for GitHub Actions output (preserve newlines)
          {
            echo "comment<<EOF"
            echo "${COMMENT}"
            echo "EOF"
          } >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.3'
          extensions: intl, mbstring, json, zip, curl
          tools: composer:v2

      - name: Install tailor
        run: composer global require typo3/tailor --prefer-dist --no-progress

      - name: Publish to TER
        run: |
          TAILOR="$(composer global config bin-dir --absolute)/tailor"
          "${TAILOR}" set-version "${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
          "${TAILOR}" ter:publish --comment "${{ steps.comment.outputs.comment }}" "${{ steps.version.outputs.version }}"
```

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Description | Where to Get |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `TYPO3_EXTENSION_KEY` | Your registered extension key | [my.typo3.org](https://my.typo3.org) |
| `TYPO3_TER_ACCESS_TOKEN` | API token for TER uploads | [extensions.typo3.org/my-extensions](https://extensions.typo3.org/my-extensions) |

### Tag Format Requirements
- **Format:** `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- **Note:** TER expects version without `v` prefix internally
- **Validation:** Workflow should validate tag format before publishing

---

## MANDATORY: TER Metadata Setup (Sidebar Links)

**CRITICAL:** The TER extension page sidebar links (Extension Manual, Found an Issue?, Code Insights, Packagist.org) are **NOT** populated from `composer.json`. They must be set explicitly via `tailor ter:update`.

Without this step, the TER page looks incomplete — no links to documentation, issues, source code, or Packagist.

### The Problem

New extensions uploaded to TER show an empty sidebar with no links:
- No "Extension Manual" button
- No "Found an Issue?" button
- No "Code Insights" button
- No "Packagist.org" button

This makes the extension appear unprofessional and hard to use.

### The Solution

Run `tailor ter:update` after the first TER upload:

```bash
TYPO3_API_TOKEN=your-token tailor ter:update \
  --composer="vendor/package-name" \
  --manual="https://github.com/vendor/repo" \
  --issues="https://github.com/vendor/repo/issues" \
  --repository="https://github.com/vendor/repo" \
  --tags="tag1,tag2,tag3" \
  extension_key
```

### Available Metadata Fields

| Option | TER Sidebar Button | Required |
|--------|--------------------|----------|
| `--manual` | Extension Manual | **YES** |
| `--issues` | Found an Issue? | **YES** |
| `--repository` | Code Insights | **YES** |
| `--composer` | Packagist.org (auto-linked) | **YES** |
| `--tags` | Search tags | Recommended |
| `--paypal` | Sponsoring link | Optional |

### When to Run

- **First release:** MANDATORY after the first `ter:publish`
- **URL changes:** Only when repository, docs, or issue tracker URLs change
- **Links persist:** Once set, they carry across all future version uploads

### Automation via CI

Add to your TER publish workflow as a post-publish step:

```yaml
- name: Update TER metadata
  if: env.FIRST_RELEASE == 'true'  # or always, idempotent
  run: |
    TAILOR="$(composer global config bin-dir --absolute)/tailor"
    "${TAILOR}" ter:update \
      --composer="${COMPOSER_NAME}" \
      --manual="${REPO_URL}" \
      --issues="${REPO_URL}/issues" \
      --repository="${REPO_URL}" \
      "${TYPO3_EXTENSION_KEY}"
```

### Verification

After setting metadata, verify on the TER page:

```bash
# Check that all 4 sidebar links are present
curl -s "https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/${EXT_KEY}" | \
  grep -c 'Extension Manual\|Found an Issue\|Code Insights\|Packagist\.org'
# Expected: 4
```

---

## Packagist Listing

Extensions with a `composer.json` should be listed on [Packagist](https://packagist.org):

1. **Submit package** at https://packagist.org/packages/submit
2. **Enable auto-update** via GitHub webhook (Packagist Settings > Enable GitHub Hook)
3. **Verify** the package appears with correct description and version

The `--composer` flag in `ter:update` creates the Packagist link on the TER page.

---

## Documentation Rendering on docs.typo3.org

Extensions with a `Documentation/` directory and `guides.xml` can have their documentation rendered at docs.typo3.org:

1. **Create** `Documentation/guides.xml` with project metadata
2. **Add RST files** following TYPO3 documentation standards
3. **Webhook** is automatically triggered when the extension is on Packagist
4. **Verify** at `https://docs.typo3.org/p/vendor/package-name/main/en-us/`

If not using docs.typo3.org, set `--manual` to the GitHub repository URL or a hosted documentation site.

---

## Release Comment Best Practices

### Writing Effective Release Notes

**Structure:**
```
Brief summary of the release (one line)

- Key change 1
- Key change 2
- Key change 3
```

**Do:**
- Start with a clear summary line
- Use bullet points for individual changes
- Group by type (Features, Fixes, Breaking)
- Keep each point concise
- Include TYPO3 version compatibility changes

**Don't:**
- Use Markdown formatting (not rendered)
- Use special characters like `#`, `*`, `<`, `>`
- Write excessively long descriptions
- Just say "Bug fixes" without details

### Example Release Notes

**Good:**
```
TYPO3 13 compatibility and performance improvements

Breaking changes:
- Minimum PHP version is now 8.2
- Removed deprecated API methods

New features:
- Added support for native lazy loading
- Improved caching for list views

Bug fixes:
- Fixed pagination in backend module
- Resolved translation loading issue
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| "No upload comment" error | Empty comment passed to tailor | Ensure fallback comment in workflow |
| Special characters in XML feed | Unsupported chars in comment | Strip `#*+=~^\|\\<>` from comments |
| Version mismatch | Tag doesn't match ext_emconf | Use `tailor set-version` before publish |
| Authentication failed | Invalid/expired API token | Regenerate token at extensions.typo3.org |
| Published with wrong / outdated upload comment | Publish ran before the release body was finalized | Re-run `tailor ter:publish --comment "..." vX.Y.Z` on the same version — TER overwrites the upload comment on republish. The ZIP contents are unchanged (the version number doesn't let you ship different code under the same version), only the comment updates. Safe to re-trigger the publish workflow after editing the GitHub release body. |

### Validation Script

Add to your workflow for pre-publish validation:
```bash
# Validate upload comment format
validate_comment() {
  local comment="$1"

  # Check not empty
  if [[ -z "${comment// }" ]]; then
    echo "::error::Upload comment cannot be empty"
    return 1
  fi

  # Check for unsupported characters
  if [[ "$comment" =~ [#*+=~^\|\\<>] ]]; then
    echo "::warning::Comment contains characters that will be stripped in XML export"
  fi

  return 0
}
```

## Technical Details

### TER API Endpoints
- **SOAP API:** Legacy, still supported (`ter_soap` extension)
- **REST API:** Modern interface (`ter_rest` extension)

### Comment Processing Pipeline
1. **Input:** Raw text from tailor CLI
2. **Validation:** Non-empty check (`ExtensionVersion.php`)
3. **Storage:** `TEXT` field in `tx_terfe2_domain_model_version`
4. **Frontend:** Fluid template with `<f:format.nl2br>`
5. **XML Export:** `xmlentities()` sanitization

### Source Code References (TER codebase)
- Validation: `extensions/ter/Classes/Api/ExtensionVersion.php:350`
- Storage: `extensions/ter_fe2/ext_tables.sql:84`
- TCA: `extensions/ter_fe2/Configuration/TCA/tx_terfe2_domain_model_version.php:80`
- Frontend: `extensions/ter_fe2/Resources/Private/Templates/Extension/Show.html:132`
- XML Export: `extensions/ter_fe2/Classes/Service/ExtensionIndexService.php:192`

## Conformance Checklist

### TER Publishing Excellence Indicators

Score the workflow along whichever of the two routes the repository took — they are alternatives, not a sequence. Applying the standalone items to a caller of the reusable workflow fails exactly the repositories that do this best.

```
GitHub Actions Workflow -- Route A: calls the reusable workflow (expected for netresearch/*):
[ ] A workflow calls netresearch/typo3-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/publish-to-ter.yml
    or .../release-typo3-extension.yml
[ ] The calling job declares permissions: contents: read (a reusable workflow whose
    inner permissions the caller did not grant fails at startup, before any job runs)
[ ] TYPO3_TER_ACCESS_TOKEN is passed through; TYPO3_EXTENSION_KEY is NOT
    (deprecated -- the key is resolved from composer.json)
-> Everything under Route B is the callee's responsibility. Do not report it here.

GitHub Actions Workflow -- Route B: standalone workflow (no reusable workflow available):
[ ] publish-to-ter.yml exists in .github/workflows/
[ ] Triggers on release published event
[ ] Validates tag format (vX.Y.Z)
[ ] Extracts version correctly (strips 'v' prefix)
[ ] Handles release body for comment
[ ] Has fallback comment if body empty
[ ] Uses typo3/tailor for publishing
[ ] Secrets properly configured

TER Metadata (MANDATORY for initial setup):
[ ] tailor ter:update --manual has been run (Extension Manual link)
[ ] tailor ter:update --issues has been run (Found an Issue link)
[ ] tailor ter:update --repository has been run (Code Insights link)
[ ] tailor ter:update --composer has been run (Packagist.org link)
[ ] All 4 sidebar links visible on extensions.typo3.org

Public Listings:
[ ] Extension page exists on extensions.typo3.org
[ ] Package exists on packagist.org
[ ] Documentation available (docs.typo3.org or linked from TER)
[ ] composer.json has support.issues URL
[ ] composer.json has support.source URL
[ ] composer.json has homepage URL

Release Process:
[ ] Semantic versioning followed
[ ] CHANGELOG.md updated before release
[ ] ext_emconf.php version bumped and committed BEFORE tagging
[ ] CI validates ext_emconf.php version matches tag (early fail)
[ ] composer.json version (if present) matches tag
[ ] Release notes follow TER format guidelines
[ ] Pre-push hook validates ext_emconf.php version locally
```
