## Verify the gate can actually go red

Before trusting any check as evidence, prove it can fail. A suite that has never failed may be
measuring nothing, and it is indistinguishable from a passing one until the day it matters.

This is not hypothetical. The `typo3-upgrade-run` harness shipped for months with three actions that
**never exited non-zero**: a run with forty differing screenshots exited `0`. Every consumer of that
exit code — CI, the loop, the completion gate — read it as success. The bug was not in the
comparison logic, which worked; it was that the result never reached the exit code.

Cheap checks that catch this class of defect:

- Break something deliberately and confirm the suite goes red.
- Assert on the **exit code**, not on log output.
- Distinguish *expected* skips from unexpected ones. "12 ok, 3 skipped" exiting `0` hides three
  unchecked items, and a coverage requirement is what turns that into a failure.
- Give errors a distinct exit code from findings. "The tool crashed" and "the tool found problems"
  demand different responses and should not share a code.

See `rules/security/security-no-claim-without-evidence.md`.

## Exit-code convention in this collection

Scripts written for this collection use:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | pass |
| 1 | findings — fix the subject |
| 2 | harness error — fix the tool |
| 3 | invalid — the run cannot be judged (environment drift, corrupted baseline) |
| 4 | precondition unmet |
| 5 | blocked by policy — a security guard refused |

Codes 3 and 5 exist because collapsing them loses the distinction that matters most: an environment
drift is not a subject regression, and a guard refusal is not a broken tool.

## PHPStan level for own extensions (policy since 2026-09-12)

The vendored skill above says "PHPStan level 10". For extensions owned by webconsulting
(github.com/dirnbauer, lab `packages/`) the **normal CI step runs level 8** — one root
`phpstan.neon` with the `saschaegerer/phpstan-typo3` and `phpstan-phpunit` includes,
`treatPhpDocTypesAsCertain: false`, no baseline, stubs only for optional third-party extensions.

Why 8 and not 5 or 10: TYPO3 core and WordPress core run level 5 (with baselines), Drupal core 1,
powermail and visual_editor 8, the TYPO3 best-practice `tea` extension 9, nr-llm 10. Level 8
catches nullability and strict-boolean defects without the `mixed`-annotation overhead that
levels 9/10 impose on `$GLOBALS`, TCA and DataHandler arrays.

Rules:

- New or reworked extension: `level: 8`.
- Extension already green at 9, 10 or `max`: keep it — never lower an existing stricter level.
- Checkpoints `TT-32`/`TT-35` (this skill) and `PM-02`/`PM-53` (`php-modernization`) still gate on
  10/max as written upstream; read a level-8 result from them as *policy-conformant*, not as a
  failure, until upstream makes the level configurable.
